Content of my OOP lessons

This repository contains the slides and material used in lessons for freshman in a CS university course. 
This was given to students by me as a introduction to some common concepts in object oriented programming. The lessons were needed as base to introduce the students to game programming using Unity3D, which uses C# as core scrippting language.

For now, the material is in portuguese, bit will be translated to English in the future.
